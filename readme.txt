Allows to load ads from your WordPress site on external pages, like your personal ad server.

== Description ==

This plugin is based on the also free [Advanced Ads ad management plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-ads/).

= Installation =

1. install Advanced Ads
3. install this plugin
2. create an ad in Advanced Ads > Ads
4. get the ad URL
5. use one of the following codes to retrieve the ad on the other sites

Using an iFrame is the most simple way. Donâ€™t forget to set the width and height attributes.

```
<iframe src="LINKTOAD" width="300" height="250"></iframe>
```

Using JavaScript could be a bit more flexible, but the call could be blocked by some browsers.

```
<div id="ad-box"></div>
<script>
	jQuery(document).ready(function(){ jQuery('#ad-box').load('LINKTOAD #ad > *'); });
</script>
```

When the ad server is installed on a different domain, this method works in browsers supporting CORS https://caniuse.com/#feat=cors
Define the 'ADVANCED_ADS_ALLOWED_HTTP_ORIGINS' constant in wp-config.php to allow incoming requests from specified origins, for example:
```
define( 'ADVANCED_ADS_ALLOWED_HTTP_ORIGINS', array( 'http://test.test' ) );
```
where `http://test.test` is the domain where you would like to place ads.
